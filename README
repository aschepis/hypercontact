Hypercontact
------------

A very simple REST API used to demonstrate how API testing works using Cloud Assault.

The API is used to maintain a list of contacts and doesn't do much else. To get started
just GET / and then check out the Link header for an idea of where to go next to get a
list of all contacts.
